This is not a vignette at all as *fritools* is just a set of
miscellaneous utilities, tools and helper functions written for the
Forest Research Institute of the State Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.

*fritools* does not use any other packages than those in the R Core.
It does not import or depend on any third party package.
